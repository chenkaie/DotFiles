	When in vim, type >

   		:help hicolors
<	
	You may use the mouse if your console vim supports it
	(see |'mouse'| |win32-mouse| |gui-mouse|) or with gvim: >
		set mouse=a or set mouse=n
		and if your terminal is xterm, msdos, or win32
<	or you may use your keyboard.

	
	COLORNAME HELP~

	A listing of all the colornames will be given in their own
	colors as assigned by your current |:colorscheme|. >

		A leftmouse click on the colorname -or-
		moving the cursor atop the colorname and pressing "?"
<
	will look up any available help for that particular color.
	Use a double-click with the leftmouse button return to the
	hicolors listing.  One may use <ctrl-o>, too.

	
	COLORSCHEME EDITING~

	Using >

		a rightmouse click  -or-
		pressing the <return> key while atop a colorname
<
	will select the color for editing.  As an example, consider changing
	DiffText: Using console vim, >

		DiffText
		                              -Bold
		  Foregnd[===============: ]  -Italic
		  Backgnd[=========:       ]  -Reverse
		                              -Underline
		
		         WriteColorscheme  Cancel  Done
<
	The colorname (DiffText) will show your current selection of
	colorization.

	You may change the foreground or background colors (click and drag
	with the left mouse button or place the cursor on the Foregnd/Backgnd
	line and press + or - .

	One may toggle beween -Bold and +Bold, -Italic and +Italic, etc,
	by either left-mouse clicks on the associated word or by placing
	the cursor on the word and hitting the <return> key.

	Using gvim, one gets a slightly different display: >

		DiffText
		         Foreground          Background          -Bold
		    Red  [===============:]  [===============:]  -Italic
		  Green  [===============:]  [:               ]  -Reverse
		   Blue  [===============:]  [:               ]  -Underline
		
		         WriteColorscheme  Cancel  Done
<
	Again, the colorname (DiffText in the example above) shows your
	current colorization selection.

	You may change the red, green, and blue contents of the foreground
	by either using a left mouse button click and drag or by hitting
	the + or - keys (with the cursor on the red, green, blue line).
	Click on "Backgnd" to change it to "Foregnd" if it isn't already.

	You may change the red, green, and blue contents of the background
	by either using a left mouse button click and drag or by hitting
	the > or < keys (with the cursor on the red, green, blue line).
	Click on "Foregnd" to change it to "Backgnd" first.

	You may make several modifications (use the "Done" label by pressing
	either the left mouse button or pressing <return> while atop the
	label).  If you wish to write a new colorscheme file, select the
	"WriteColorscheme" label (left mouse click or <return> when atop it).
	You will then be queried for what the new colorscheme's filename
	shall be.

	Put the new colorscheme into your .vim/colors directory, and put >

<	into your <.vimrc> file.

4. History						*hicolors-history*

	v9 Oct 02, 2006 * <buffer> modifier used with various maps
	   Jul 23, 2007 * the various maps in ChgColor were inadvertently
	                  deactivated by the Oct 2 change -- those maps
			  were active in the colornames listing rather
			  than the colorname editor.  Fixed.
	   Jul 27, 2007 * included <2-leftmouse> to return from help
	                  to colorscheme listing
	   Sep 03, 2008 * included additional highlighting color labels
			  that are new with vim 7.2

			  up help on hicolors itself
	v8 May 05, 2006 * Vim 7.0's new colors all included
	                * When one changes the colorscheme, all colors that
			  should be "Ignore"d now are so linked; these
			  colors aren't specified by the current colorscheme.

	                  xterms

	                * this help file, hicolorshelp.txt, included
	v5 Apr 13, 2005 * Bug fix: now handles highlighting groups that are
	                  defined without explicit colorization (ie. something with just
	                  gui=reverse, for example).

	v3 Sep 03, 2004 * first release
