# Skip certificate checking

check_certificate = off

# By default Wget uses "passive FTP" transfer where the client
# initiates the data connection to the server rather than the other
# way around.  That is required on systems behind NAT where the client
# computer cannot be easily reached from the Internet.  However, some
# firewalls software explicitly supports active FTP and in fact has
# problems supporting passive transfer.  If you are in such
# environment, use "passive_ftp = off" to revert to active FTP.
#passive_ftp = off
passive_ftp = on
